# Workspace Task Manager

## Description

Workspace Task Manager is a feature rich task management web application built on a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Django and JavaScript.
 It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks and workspaces. Whether its organizing personal to-do lists or collaborating with colleagues on work-related projects, it caters to both the needs.

## Distinctiveness & Complexity

This project's fulfillment of distinctiveness and complexity requirements is evidenced by the following:

- This application's distinctiveness is evident in its versatile workspace management, role-based task creation, customizable task prioritization, support for both individual and team workspaces, member addition, task manipulation, multiple to-do lists within a single workspace, notification feature, responsiveness, multiple navbars, and dynamic updates via AJAX.

- In 'Work' category workspaces, differentiating between creators and members, and loading specific content, involved intricate coding and meticulous testing.
- Adding role-based access control made things more complicated. It allowed creators to have full control over tasks but needed careful management to limit what members could do.
- Allowing creators to manage tasks across multiple workspaces demanded complex model design, dynamic front-end handling across various sections, which posed a challenge.
- Achieving responsiveness for small screen sizes with numerous icons and text in the side navbar was also a significant challenge.


# Files and Description

This Django Project consists of a single app named `taskManager`. All of the app's files are located within the `/taskManager` directory. The `urls.py` file within this directory contains URL patterns for both the web application and APIs.

The `views.py` file contains numerous functions, each documented with specific functionality in their respective docstrings.

Within the `/templates/taskManager` directory, you'll find 5 HTML templates:

1. `index.html`: This serves as the main landing page when opening the app. It dynamically generates the sign-in and register forms through the associated JavaScript file `index.js`.

2. `notification.html`: This template is used for displaying notifications and inherits from `layout.html`.

3. `createWork.html`: This template is for creating new workspaces and inherits from `layout.html`.

4. `indi_workspace.html`: This template inherits from `layout.html`, which includes a side navbar. `workspace.js` is linked to `indi_workspace.html`, containing functions that make API calls and dynamically modify page content.

Additionally, there are two CSS files:

1. `layout.css`: This file contains styling information for the layout.

2. `style.css`: This file contains additional styling rules for the application.

## Features:

1. **User Account Creation**
   - Users create accounts to manage workspaces and task lists.

2. **New Workspace Creation**
   - Upon signing in, users access a workspace creation form.
   - Form includes fields for title (text), description (textarea), and category (select: 'Personal' or 'Work'). Choosing 'Work' adds user checkboxes, with at least one selection required.
   - After workspace creation, users are redirected to the workspace page.

3. **Task Lists**
   - Within workspaces, users click '+ ADD NEW LIST' to create task lists.
   - They must enter title and click 'Create' to add the task list.
   - Task lists are accessible via the 'Lists' dropdown in the top navbar.

4. **Task Creation**
   - In each task list, below the title, there's a form with a 'Save' button to add tasks.
   - For Personal workspaces, users input task, due-date, and priority.
   - In Work workspaces, creators assign tasks to members, inputting task, due-date, priority, and assignee.
   - Non-creators in Work workspaces can't add tasks.

5. **Task Management**
   - Users view, edit, or delete tasks.
   - Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the leftmost button.

6. **Task Management in Work Workspaces**
   - Workspace members view assigned tasks but can't edit or delete them.
   - They can only mark tasks as completed.
   - Creators can edit, delete tasks, and assign them.

7. **Notifications**
   - Users receive notifications when added to 'Work' category workspaces. Notifications are accessible in their notification page.
